<h1>Planes</h1>
<h4>By Alex</h4>
<p>This page is an overview of my website. it is about one of my passions, planes. The following images (except one) are taken by myself.

<p>The contents of this website contain the following: two types of planes, small paragraphs about them and a small description about the images, along with a final page containing the history of planes and their uses.  </p>

<p>I got interested in the aviation world at the start of 2024 when I went on holiday in the South Island. before that, I hadn't been on a plane since 2018 so I was very hyped and optimistic. After this, my eagerness to see planes eventually led to me going planespotting. It is a very fun activity (although quite long) if you're a aviation enthusiast and especially if you like loud noises, great photo opportunities, and just being in the moment. </p>
