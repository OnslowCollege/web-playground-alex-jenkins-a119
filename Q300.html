        <h1>What is the Q300?</h1>
        <p>The Q300 is a turboprop regional airliner operated around the world although not as prominently as other planes in service today. It serves an important role in regional fleets and is crucial to their success. </p>
        <br>
        <br> 
        <p>The Q300 was introduced in 1984 via DHC which was then bought by Boeing in 1986 and then by Bombardier in 1992. It's own evolution started with the 100 series(1984-2005), the series 200(1995-2009), the series 300(1989-2009), and the series 400(1999-2022), all with varying capacity from 37 up to 90 seats. </p>

        <p>This photo was also taken at Wellington International Airport in early 2025 when I went planespotting. It shows this Q300 taking off to the north via runway 34.</p>
